      <h1>Stories of Every Animal on The Chinese Zodiac</h1>
      <p><i>Long, long ago, the Chinese Zodiac did not exist.The Jade Emperor wished to select twelve
        animals as his guards. So, he sent an immortal being into the human world to spread the message
        that the earlier one entered the Heavenly Gate, the better the rank one would recieve. That is how
        the order came to be as Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.</i>
